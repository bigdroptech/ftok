    <div class="span12 well" style="margin-left: 0px;width: 110%;">
    <p>FTOK has been working with several cooperatives in East Africa to uplift the livelihoods of smallholder producers. Through improved productivity and streamlined marketing systems, smallholder producers are able increase incomes from on and off farm enterprises hence improved living standards. </p>
<h4>Food security</h4>
<p>
Population growth has been growing geometrically with food production assuming arithmetic model in the recent past hence posing a lot of challenge in food security. Due to this, FTOK has taken the initiative to train farmers on diversification to increase on food security. FTOK lays more emphasis on every house hold to have a chicken, goat and a cow so that they can have a balanced diet. Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life</p>
<p>There is strong, direct relationships between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live in rural areas make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child malnutrition are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher the proportion of the rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. 
</p>

<h4>Housing</h4>
<p>
Due to the recent increase in population growth in Kenya, the housing sector has been unable to provide sufficient affordable housing to its residents. The shortage of both land and housing is a result of a complicated land tenure history, inefficient regulatory frameworks, and under-resourced projects to improve housing. Those most affected by the lack of housing are primarily from lower income groups and farmers. FTOK in its effort to increase coffee production and quality of coffee has made coffee farmers to start building better and permanent houses hence improved living standards
</p>
<h4>Health</h4>
<p>
Health is a very important aspect of life. Improved food security leads to improved health. Due to continuous capacity building by FTOK farmers have been able to seek for health care from both government hospitals and private dispensaries. Tropical diseases, especially malaria and tuberculosis, have long been a public health problem in developing countries. In recent years, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) also has become a severe problem. FTOK in all its programs has put emphasis in educating farmers on HIV/AIDS. FTOK has created awareness to farmers about the diseases and how to deal with them.

    <h4>Why empower women?</h4>
    <p>
<p>Studies show that when women are supported and empowered, all of society benefits. Their families are healthier, more children go to school, agricultural productivity improves and incomes increase</p>
<p>Enabling and empowering of women is not only developmentally important, but ethically right. However, it is well acknowledged that many, if not most women are excluded by all kinds of constraints. Targeting the poorest women and giving them not only hope but improved livelihoods and skills to engage on key issues affecting them and their families is an important part of reducing poverty and crucial to real development.  Promoting women's leadership and participation at higher levels is also necessary.</p>
<p>
Women's empowerment strategy
<ul>
<li>Improve the economic status of women through self reliance approaches</li>
<li>Encourage group formation and innovativeness.</li>
<li>Capacity building on value addition and marketing.</li>
<li>Facilitate the strengthening of social support structures to address social issues affecting women and their families.</li>
<li>Linking then with women enterprise funds.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Why is women's economic empowerment important for development?
<ul>
<li>To speed up development and the process of overcoming poverty. </li>
<li>Women usually reinvest a much higher portion in their families and communities than men, spreading wealth beyond them. This could be one reason why countries with greater gender equality tend to have lower poverty rates.</li>
<li>Investing in women is a smart way to mitigate the negative effects of the crisis and help rebuild the economies of the world. </li>

    <div class="span12 well" style="margin-left: 0px;width: 110%;">
    <p>
    Climate change has affected agricultural production through unpredictable rainfall patterns and excessive droughts, making crop management and disease control a nightmare. We have also seen climate change in intermittent rainfall patterns, extended drought and inauspicious high temperatures</p>
<p>
FTOK continuous does capacity building and campaigns on environment and climate change. It has encouraged farmers to plant trees and practice organic farming which is environmentally friendly. FTOK has also come up with an agronomy hand book which also emphasizes on environment conservation; and adaptation and mitigation of climate change

    <p>FTOK has competence staff trained by International Labour Organisation(ILO) on entrepreneurship who build capacity of youth on the same.  Through capacity building on entrepreneurship, Women and Youth Groups have been able expand their new ventures and start new enterprises besides diversification into the other on and off farm enterprises. Capacity building on Farming as a business has made many youth and women to be economically self-reliant through employment creation</p>
    <p>
FTOK does trainings to women on group formation and financial management. Substantial business development services are available, but may not be accessible to most women entrepreneurs. Lack of information on who is offering what and the cost of obtaining such services are some of the limitations faced by these entrepreneurs. 
</p>
<p>	
The second most common form of Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) support is management, which emphasizes on business skills, entrepreneurship and technical training related to MSEs' line of business. FTOK offers technical assistance (TA) emphasizing business extension, marketing, bookkeeping, inventory, costing, production and choice of appropriate technology. </p>

    <span class="span12 label label-success" style="padding: 8px;text-align: justify;width: 110%;margin-bottom: 10px;"><h4>Product certification</h4></span>
    <div class="span12 well" style="margin-left: 0px;width: 110%;">

<p>
<b>Product certification</b> is the process of certifying that a certain product has passed performance tests and quality assurance tests, and meets qualification criteria stipulated in contracts, regulations, or specifications. Product certification indicates a product's suitability to be distributed to the masses safely, guaranteeing that whatever's in the labels are real. It also means that the merchandises is distributed and sold fairly between the producers, consumers and middlemen. Standards and requirements depend on what kind of product is dealt with and the factors surrounding its use and production
</p>
<p>
Product certification is important since it assures that the product is suited for distribution and public consumption; assures producers are given a fair share of the sale of their products; signifies desire of producer organizations to improve their profit fairly and honestly without taking advantage of smallholders producers and/or consumers; demonstrates consumers' awareness not only for their welfare, but also the perpetuation of quality goods and services through mandatory certification; allows consumers to purchase quality goods for the right price; compels producers to provide the best quality goods at all times as it raises the overall bar for goods and services in the market; and  promotes good production practices while rewarding the efforts of consumers</p>
<p>
FTOK supports producer organizations to acquire and maintain certification standards of their products. This is done through capacity building of producers and producer organizations on the benefits of certified products; sensitizing producer organizations on requirements of various certifications standards and building their capacity to attain them; linking producer organizations to certification bodies to acquire certificate of conformity and approval to apply product certification mark; conducting periodic monitoring and evaluation to ensure producer organizations comply to the certification standards;  linking producer organizations to direct market of certified products to ensure fair returns of their products; and  instituting Internal Control Systems to the producer Organizations to ensure sustainable compliance to the product certification standards

<p>The FTOK obligation is to strengthen producer organizations to serve their members efficiently and effectively. Through such organizations, smallholder producers are cushioned from productions and marketing constraints whose spiral effect results in price volatility making them undergo huge losses from their agricultural enterprises.</p>
<p>Strong producer organizations are able to aggregate produce, add value to the products and collectively market on behalf of its farmers. By this approach, farmers are able to get higher returns from their produce since they enjoy economies of scale. FTOK approach has always been bringing together producers of various commodities to form strong organizations or supporting established organizations to make them strong to thrive in competitive business environment.</p>
<p>Cooperatives have demonstrated as best device for assisting marginalized smallholder producers to overcome many challenges arising from globalization and market liberalization. FTOK has been on the forefront to strengthen cooperatives among other producer organizations.
</p>
<p>
